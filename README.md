# Introduction 
This project demonstrates use of the JavaScript DTDL parser. The npm package is available [here](comming soon). These are samples on how to use the the JavaScript dtdl parser in a node or react project to validate dtdl models.

# What the code demonstrates
* Basic use of the DTDL parser for validation of DTDL
* Basic use of the object model to access information about DTDL content

# Node - Getting started

After you have cloned the repo and opened it, go to the `node-app` directory.

From the command line run `yarn install` to install the node modules

Now build and run your sample

```bash
npm run build

node dist\src\parse_file.js
```
